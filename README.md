# iOS-journey

Repository aimed to accelerate my Swift and SwiftUI learning by creating markdown notes of what I learn along the way

### How it is sorted

Each folder describes specific topic. Within each folder may be one or more markdown files with code examples to accompany them.

### Why it was created

Along the way I may forget a thing or two, that's why I'm creating this little documentation for myself. Packed as much content as possible and categorized correctly, this repo will be on pair with GPT-4o :smile:
